    <h1>KIRILL KRAVINSKY</h1>

    <p>Currently, I'm CTO of <a href="https://slash.com">Slash</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Previously, I was CTO and leading developer of Tensorpad, a platform for data scientists that helps quickly 
      experiment and train machine learning models, running on a GPU cluster. We provided both software and hardware 
      to many ML and AI projects. Many of them have succeeded and now are on the edge of innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that, I was working with a team of very talented people at <a href="https://ampme.com">AmpMe</a>, where 
      we developed a cross-platform app that allowed synchronized multi-device music streaming.  I was excited about 
      the project back in the day, as my university honours paper is about probabilistic clock synchronization â€” that 
      is something you should get right to create an excellent cross-device synchronized music playback experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started programming in 2003 and developed a few websites for the local community.  Then I have been developing 
      simple-yet-fun games, improving and extending server-side software for online games. With the introduction of iPhone 
      OS SDK in 2008, I started working on mobile apps.
    </p>

    <h2>BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS AND INSPIRATION</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation
      of Computer Programs</a>, along with the epic 1986 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090">
        video course</a> is one of my favourites. In my opinion, anyone interested in programming must go ahead and dig into those.
        If you haven't touched functional programming yet, SICP is a great way to do so. It will give you a clear view of
        how to do things the other way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X">Site Reliability Engineering</a>
      is a great book that will give you valuable insight into how large companies run their massive production systems. <i>Note: it doesn't
      mean that your small startup should employ these techniques.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom-ebook/dp/B00P5URD96/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31HJH9GS89H8T&dchild=1&keywords=game+programming+patterns&qid=1598783988&s=books&sprefix=game+prog%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C261&sr=1-1">
      Game Programming Patterns</a> is an excellent read to learn quite a few programming techniques that apply to all kinds of 
      applications, not only games, despite the name. It will level you up as a programmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a> is an easy read that will give you
      an accurate idea of how operating systems work. I believe that it is essential for any software developer to demystify the OS layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230">Grokking Algorithms</a> will visually
      explain common algorithms in a way that you will never forget. Essential!
